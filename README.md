# BG3 Coop Dialog Edits



## About

This mod is a heavily work-in-progress adjustment to multiplayer dialog handling in Baldurs Gate 3. Expect bugs, and potentially game-breaking ones at that! 

My intention was to make my own co-op sessions a little less chaotic since I found it quite the bother how chaotic things get when the party doesn't stick together at all times.

Features planned and present currently include

- [x] Force add all characters into a dialog at start.
  - [x] Optionally with distance/region limit.
- [x] Toggle random or skill (Charisma/Initiative roll) based dialog leadership.
   - [x] Optionally Exclude followers and camp.
   - [x] Opt in/out of randomized Dialog
- [x] Enable dialog with grouped followers for the non-owner.
- [x] Let specific characters make a claim to dialog ownership. (Semi-implemented via Opt-In feature)
- [ ] Ask to defer important or special dialogs to another player
- [ ] Check whether dialog target wants to talk to a particular player-controlled character
- [ ] Hack the dialog system some more to function like in SWTOR.

Larian pls.
